Wear Pack for Pebble
====================



Overview
--------

*Salesforce1 Pebble Dashboard* comes with all the required code to connect to
your Pebble Watch to your Salesforce instance (Org).  The application will
connect using OAuth and use the Salesforce Analytics APIs to pull the totals
from three reports and display the information as a dashboard on the watch
screen.  The application will enable easy access to critical business data in an unobtrusive way.  With the real-time nature of the data collected in Salesforce, the *Salesforce1 Pebble Dashboard* will now make it easy to keep an eye on those critical metrics.



The *Pebble Dashboard app* will display the information that is important to you in a similar format to the following image.

Every time you access the *Pebble Dashboard app* or click on one of the report line items, the application will use the Analytics API to make a REST call to request the udpated numbers from Salesforce and display the totals from the Salesforce Report.



The above image enables a manager to see their important metrics.

-   Track the SLA the statistics to understand the daily trending patterns
    before it is too late to address an issue.

-   Monitor the team's financial measurements for daily, weekly or quarterly
    attainment to help direct the team's focus to meet identified targets.

-   See the number of urgent Case or Tickets that are outstanding and need to be
    resolved so they know if the team's assignments should be modified to
    address the caseload.

The same process could be focused on individual users interests.

-   My open cases assigned for completion today would let me track my progress
    and allocate my time appropriately.

-   The percentage of my sales attainment for this month reminds me of my target
    and monthly progress.

-   Number of seats remaining in a class or other scheduled event to easily see
    key information that I may need to share with my clients.

Or take this sample code and expand it to display or enter any information your
highly mobile team requires.
