WearablePack-Pebble
===================



Overview
--------

The Wear Pack for Pebble includes the *Pebble Dashboard app*, which displays key summary metrics from up to three Salesforce Dashboards or Reports. The app is written in JavaScript using the PebbleKit JavaScript Framework and uses the Force.com Analytics API to query report data from Salesforce and display it on the watch.



The *Pebble Dashboard app* will display the information that is
important to you in a similar format to the following image.

Every time you access the *Pebble Dashboard app* or click on one of the
report line items, the application will use the Analytics API to make a REST
call to request the udpated numbers from Salesforce and display the totals from
the Salesforce Report.

This sample application is part of the <a href="http://developer.salesforce.com/wear" target="_blank">Salesforce Wear Developer Pack</a>, a collection of open-source starter apps that let you quickly design and build wearable apps that connect to the Salesforce1 Platform.
